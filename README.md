# breastCancer_nueral_network

This project implements a breast cancer classifier using a neural network. The classifier is trained on a dataset of breast cancer data to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. This README provides an overview of the project, dataset information, model architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and usage instructions.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to assist in the early detection of breast cancer by predicting the likelihood of a tumor being malignant or benign based on input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the classifier is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features include characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, fractal dimension, etc.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model architecture used for the breast cancer classifier consists of several layers including:
- Input layer
- Hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with sigmoid activation (for binary classification)

The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent optimization to minimize the binary cross-entropy loss function.

## Training Process

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing). The model is trained on the training set using batch training or mini-batch training with a specified number of epochs. During training, the model's performance is monitored using validation data to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the breast cancer classifier is evaluated using:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified samples
- 
## Usage

To use the breast cancer classifier:
1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
3. Preprocess your own breast cancer data if needed (ensure it has the same features as the training dataset).
4. Load the trained model weights (if available) or train the model using your data.
5. Use the model to predict the likelihood of breast tumors being malignant or benign.
